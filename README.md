# Proof-of-concept of `execve()`
This is a really simple application that uses `execve()`-systemcall typ update it self and restart.
## How to build
Just open the .pro-file in QtCreator

## How to run
- Open the command-line
- Copy the file qt-execve-test to qt-execve-test-running
- Start the application by typing `./qt-execve-test-running`

After five seconds it will check if there is a file called `qt-execve-test`. It that file exeists ith will replace the current running program, `qt-execve-test-running` and execute `execve()`.

Notice that the PID will not change.
## TODO
- Make the argument passing to `execve()` dynamic.
- Test with a more complex application. One that has file open, a number of threads etc.
